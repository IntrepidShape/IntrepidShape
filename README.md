# 👋 Hi there, I'm IntrepidShape (Your username)

* I am a passionate **`code craftsman`** and truly, a **`jack of all trades`**.👨‍💻
* My interests intersect in a variety of spheres: Software, Web development, Gaming, Electronic music, Cryptocurrency, Personal Development, Linguistics, Esoteric subjects, Geometry, and Artificial Intelligence. 🌐
* Professionally, I've diversified from being a pure programmer to a true 'generalist'.🛠
 

## ⚙ Favourite Tools and Technologies 

* **AstroBuild** - The ideal tool to quickly craft a high-performing web project. 
* **UnrealEngine** - The Royalty among Engines, with countless years of refinement. I am more inclined to use C++, but Blueprints are pretty nifty too!
* **Elm** - Just as its tagline suggests, it provides a genuinely "Delightful" developer experience.
* **Go** - Helps seal the deal without getting down into the rabbit hole (*cough* Rust). 

✨But remember, tools are only as useful as the craftsman wielding them!

## 🔧 Tools I've Worked With 

* **TypeScript** - Hey, it helps keep the lights on! It might just be a bandage over Javascript's legacy issues, but I have to admit, it does its job. 

## 🚀 Current Projects 

At present, I'm navigating through Stephen Ulibarri's Unreal Engine 5 C++ Multiplayer Shooter course. Catch me live-stream the development journey on my [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/hadrianfocus) channel.
